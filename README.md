# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to make changes to the PlanMyTrip app. The goal is to take the app to the next level by adding the weather description to the weather data which was already provided to us. After making those changes the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta testers would then choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. THen using the Maps. Directions API, we will create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer map.

This project consists of three technical analyses. We will submit the following deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
* Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
